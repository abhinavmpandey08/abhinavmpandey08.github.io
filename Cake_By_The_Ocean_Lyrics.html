		<p id="lyrics">Oh no<br>
			See you walking 'round like it's a funeral<br>
			Not so serious, girl; why those feet cold?<br>
			We just getting started; don't you tip toe, tip toe<br><br>

			Ah!<br>
			Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh!)<br>
			You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me (ah)<br>
			You're a real life fantasy, you're a real life fantasy (huh!)<br>
			But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously<br><br>
	
			Talk to me, baby<br>
			I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa<br>
			[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy<br>
			[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy<br>
			Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean<br>
			Walk for me, baby<br>
			I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa<br>
			[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy<br>
			[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy<br>
			Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)<br><br>

			[Explicit:] God damn<br>
			[Clean and radio:] Hot damn<br>
			See you licking frosting from your own hands<br>
			Want another taste, I'm begging, "Yes, ma'am."<br>
			I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, oh<br><br>

			Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh!)<br>
			You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me (ah)<br>
			You're a real life fantasy, you're a real life fantasy (huh!)<br>
			But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously<br>
			Whoa<br><br>

			Talk to me, baby<br>
			I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa<br>
			[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy<br>
			[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy<br>
			Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean<br>
			Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)<br>
			I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa<br>
			[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy<br>
			[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy<br>
			Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean<br>
			Oh ah<br>
			Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean<br>
			Oh ah<br>
			Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)<br><br>

			[Explicit:] You're fucking delicious<br>
			[Clean and radio:] You're crazy delicious<br>
			Talk to me, girl<br><br>

			Talk to me, baby<br>
			I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa<br>
			[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy<br>
			[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy<br>
			Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean<br>

			[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy<br>
			[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy<br>
			Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)<br><br>

			Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life<br>
			Funfetti, I'm ready; I need it every night<br>
			Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life<br>
			Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)<br>
